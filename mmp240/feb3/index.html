        <p>The Multimedia Programming and Design Program prepares students for careers in a
          variety of multimedia industries, companies and institutions that develop, produce or
          market multimedia products, programs or services. The program instructs students in the design
          and programming of computer-based interactive products that incorporate text, graphics, sound,
          animation and video. It also develops different types of talent, both creative and technical, with
